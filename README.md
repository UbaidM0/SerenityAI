# SerenityAI (HackUTA 1st Place)

# What It Does
SerenityAI is an AI-powered mental health companion that offers personalized support, including emotional check-ins, coping strategies, and tailored resources for managing stress and anxiety. It has a built-in chatbot trained to answer your personal queries and act as your personal therapist. SerenityAIâ€™s chatbot processes the input using an LLM trained on therapeutic responses.

# How We Built It
We developed SerenityAI using a robust tech stack including React, Node and Tailwind CSS for the Frontend, which we integrated with our Python backend through the Flask framework and APIs. We also leveraged Databricks technologies such as LanceDB, as a vector store for dynamic context retrieval, and Delta Lakes, for structured conversation history maintenance and token limit optimization.
